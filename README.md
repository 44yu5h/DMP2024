# DMP
The [Dedicated Mentoring
Program](https://www.codeforgovtech.in/c4gt-2024/) is a place for
students and professionals to contribute to critical tech building
blocks with the guidance of a dedicated mentor.

Sugar Labs will be participating in DMP 2024. Details to
follow. Meanwhile, look for tickets with the **DMP2024** tag.

Applications for the program are now open and contributors can apply
via [this portal](https://bit.ly/DMP2024_Unstop) and access all the
live projects [here](https://bit.ly/DMP2024ProjectList). The
applications close on 1st May for the contributors post which the
mentors will need to share the final shortlists.

Potential contributors:
* Please refer to the [Sugar Labs documentation](https://github.com/sugarlabs/sugar-docs) in regard to our code of conduct, communications guide, and getting started.
* Please note that only projects with the **DMP2024** tag will be available this year (we need to start slowly in our first year in the program).
